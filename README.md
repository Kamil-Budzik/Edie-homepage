I built this project quite a long time ago. During that time, I wasn't able to use Grid, so I created a fully responsive project only using Flexbox and media queries. I didn't know how to use webpack, so that's why I have more than 1 CSS file. I know this is not optimal and for sure I would use webpack here.
